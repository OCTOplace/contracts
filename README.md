# Octoplace Contracts Repository

Welcome to the Octoplace Contracts repository! This repository contains all the smart contracts that are being used in the Octoplace project. These contracts are written in the Solidity programming language and are an integral part of our decentralized application.

## Overview

- **Solidity Contracts:** The contracts in this repository are implemented in Solidity, a popular programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.

- **Hardhat Tooling:** We use Hardhat, a powerful development environment and tool suite for Ethereum, for building, testing, and deploying our contracts. It simplifies the smart contract development process and makes it easier to manage the development lifecycle.
